"Extend lock time for position #123 by 26 weeks"
"Check cooldown period for position #123"
"Check warmup period for position #123"
"Unstake my tokens from position #123"
```

## Important Notes

### Lock Duration
- Maximum lock duration is 52 weeks
- Longer lock duration results in higher voting power
- Lock duration cannot be reduced, only extended

### Cooldown and Warmup
- Positions have cooldown periods when unstaking
- New positions have warmup periods before gaining full voting power
- These periods cannot be bypassed

### Voting Power
- Voting power depends on amount staked and lock duration
- Higher amounts and longer locks = more voting power
- Voting power decays linearly as lock expiration approaches
